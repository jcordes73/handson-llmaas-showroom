= Module 3.1: Introduction to Parasol AI Studio

== Introduction

Welcome to the Parasol AI Studio lab environment. In this lab, you have access to a fully configured AI application platform that makes enterprise AI accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background or AI expertise.

Parasol AI Studio is a specialized dashboard that transforms complex AI infrastructure into a simple, intuitive application launcher. Unlike traditional AI platforms that require understanding of model endpoints, API authentication, and configuration parameters, Parasol AI Studio provides a one-click experience for launching pre-configured AI-enabled applications.

== What is Parasol AI Studio?

Parasol AI Studio is a custom fork of the Open Data Hub dashboard, specifically designed to eliminate the complexity of working with AI applications and models. The platform automatically handles all the technical details—from provisioning user accounts to configuring API endpoints and authentication tokens—allowing you to focus on using AI applications rather than configuring them.

=== Key Objectives

The main goals of Parasol AI Studio are:

* **Simplify AI Access**: Enable anyone to use AI applications without requiring knowledge of AI, models, or APIs
* **Automatic Provisioning**: Handle all user and application setup automatically in the background
* **Seamless Integration**: Connect applications to Models-as-a-Service (MaaS) without manual configuration
* **Ready-to-Use Applications**: Provide pre-configured workbenches that are immediately productive

== Main Features and Capabilities

=== Automatic User and Application Provisioning

When you launch an application through Parasol AI Studio, the system automatically:

* Creates or retrieves your MaaS user account
* Generates application-specific API tokens
* Configures model endpoint URLs
* Injects credentials into your workbench environment
* Starts the application ready to use

Most of these steps have been part of xref:module-01-03-api.adoc#api-gateway[Module 1.3: AI at Scale with an API Gateway] but were done manually.

=== Models-as-a-Service (MaaS) Integration

The platform seamlessly integrates with Models-as-a-Service, providing access to various AI capabilities:

* **Large Language Models (LLM)**: Granite models for text generation, chat, and reasoning
* **Image Generation**: Stable Diffusion XL for creating images from text descriptions
* **Document Processing**: Docling for extracting and processing document content
* **Safety and Guardrails**: Content filtering and safety mechanisms

All model connections are established automatically—you never need to manually configure endpoints or manage API keys.

=== Custom Workbench Management

Parasol AI Studio provides specialized workbench environments, each tailored for specific AI use cases. These workbenches are pre-configured container environments that include all necessary tools, libraries, and integrations.

== Available AI Applications

The lab environment includes several pre-configured AI applications, each designed for different use cases:

== How Parasol AI Studio Works

=== The User Experience

From a user perspective, getting started with any AI application is remarkably simple:

* **Create a project**
+
[.bordershadow]
image:03/01-create_project_1.png[width="100%"]
+
and provide a name {user}-parasol-ai and hit `Create`
+
[.bordershadow]
image:03/01-create_project_2.png[width="100%"]
+
Now you are ready to create your first Parasol AI Studio application
* **Select an Application**
+
First choose `Create an application`
+
[.bordershadow]

+
Under `Type` you can select from a range of applications
+
[.bordershadow]
image:03/01-application_options.png[width="100%"]
* **Provide a Name**: Give your application a meaningful name
* **Create**: Click to create the application
+
[.bordershadow]
image:03/01-create_application_2.png[width="100%"]
* **Use**: Access your fully configured application immediately


Behind the scenes, Parasol AI Studio handles all the complexity:

* Checking if you have a MaaS user account (creating one if needed)
* Generating application-specific tokens via the 3Scale API
* Creating the workbench pod with injected environment variables
* Configuring all model endpoints and credentials
* Starting the application container

=== The Technical Architecture (High-Level)

While you don't need to understand the technical details to use the platform, it's helpful to know what's happening:

**Frontend Layer**: A React-based dashboard built with PatternFly components provides the user interface. This is what you interact with when selecting and launching applications.

**Backend Layer**: A Node.js/TypeScript backend using Fastify handles API requests, manages MaaS integration, and orchestrates Kubernetes resources.

**MaaS Integration**: The platform communicates with Models-as-a-Service APIs to provision users and applications, retrieve tokens, and configure endpoints.

**Kubernetes/OpenShift**: Workbenches run as containerized pods in OpenShift, with all configuration injected via environment variables.

== Key Use Cases

=== Scenario 1: Knowledge Worker Building a Custom Chatbot

A knowledge worker wants to create a chatbot that can answer questions about company documentation:

1. Launch the **AnythingLLM** workbench
2. Upload company documents, PDFs, and knowledge base articles
3. Configure RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) settings in the UI
4. Test the chatbot by asking questions
5. Share access with team members


=== Scenario 2: Developer Learning a New Framework

A developer wants to learn a new programming framework with AI assistance:

1. Launch the **Code Server with Continue.dev** workbench
2. Open project files in the browser-based IDE
3. Ask AI questions about the framework
4. Get code suggestions and explanations as you work
5. Generate sample code and tests

The workbench is pre-configured with AI capabilities—no manual setup of API keys or model endpoints.

=== Scenario 3: Business Analyst Exploring Documents

A business analyst needs to extract insights from hundreds of PDF reports. Using Parasol AI Studio:

1. Launch the **Docling Serve UI** workbench
2. Upload PDF documents for processing
3. Extract structured data, tables, and key information
4. Export results for further analysis

No need to understand document processing APIs or configure authentication—just upload and process.

=== Scenario 4: Marketing Team Creating Visual Content

A marketing team needs to quickly generate concept images for a campaign:

1. Launch the **Stable Diffusion XL Studio** workbench
2. Enter text descriptions of desired images
3. Generate and refine images iteratively
4. Download final images for use in marketing materials

The image generation model is ready to use immediately—no configuration required.

All LLM connections and API authentication are handled automatically by the platform.
